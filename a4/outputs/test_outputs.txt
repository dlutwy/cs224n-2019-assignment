You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is generally something that fell into a place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle years, at middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and it was 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults have never come to know us.
You could help Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of his family because it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary, because necessary, it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to be, as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> about <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they come out of glaciers or break down the sheets of ice.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and hold it up to the end, while others can't afford to get into a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As it melts a <unk> it releases rich <unk> freshwater that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there exist in that way, and will never exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, it's a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's often frequent to actually get a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here they are.
You can see the left of a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, the man is standing there.
This is an average <unk> <unk>
<unk> out of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, a baby <unk> OK.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too in the details of conception, because if you stop to think about it, you know, I'm not going to pay attention.
So let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that in an event, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other, the X X <unk> joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it begins life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground to get two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that means of humans and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who have been much lower than average.
And I worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical reaction doesn't fit into male schemes, male and conventional female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of a lot of ways of having sex in the common or male forms or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene, and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that becomes <unk>
And then in the <unk> <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks his testosterone, body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without feedback.
As a result, the body develops on a very female course.
When you take the baby <unk> it looks like a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a girl.
And so often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing my toes, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing examinations they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body, something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I consider to be a <unk> woman who doesn't know their structure <unk> I believe being a typical woman most of the women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that are born with <unk>
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from an 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, he had a life and sex with her, had a life like a boy and he had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> chromosomes in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that essentially they created a male hormone environment.
And as a result, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what is known as a <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgeries -- not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we went to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having an identity <unk> <unk> being black, wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
<unk> very simplistic.
And when you presented a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The most high time is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you that there are no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go to the science, we have to admit that these categories were -- we thought of these categories were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of the terminology is.
So as we look, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science and we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all kinds of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at first and at end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know about the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
Like a lot of <unk> put a pen in front of your nose, and if it was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of determining the death of someone. And this is what puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
And so we found that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with <unk>
<unk> <unk> were the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a concept of <unk> and it <unk> with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what we <unk> our brother <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear <unk>
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming to political power from the right of the blood right to the father and then the son, etc.
The Wright <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they make part of a <unk> system where two things were made.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the story of the brother <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the explanations for <unk> and therefore they <unk> the concept of being transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth to birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and from the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing that, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened here next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color that we were talking about <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be aware of anatomy.
I don't want to say that the children of five years should be allowed to have sex or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: was born on March 1 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the vote of sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born later.
We found other people's rights.
Henry, for virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> she doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, <unk> doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we got to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are trapped in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for people at all.
But this is also very strange by given the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I loved <unk> offers a solution.
And he says that we should judge people not <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people on the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I am not sure that we should take care of this to help people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships than I know about.
So how do we put the theme of the content on <unk>
And it turns out it's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to lead this current thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> <unk> unless he is willing to submit to a change of sex in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon with which I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth twins <unk> and then pick them out of his fame.
But when the phone asked the purpose of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are not <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, I mean, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had given greater involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different backgrounds, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies <unk> is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was considered a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> stereotypes -- so there's no female on the <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, the more I think about the question of the <unk> is that there is something about women's <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very excited to find a way to protect the people by the state, it is possible that we had more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk> support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we define democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about the relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily join the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just went through the buildings in apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments already are owners and that the other half is still not the lack of doing it.
You could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we think about is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid all the lengths to avoid all the lengths of building and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, and build a building of apartment apartments that is always new, and when the rules of that site will build in time to build it.
So I proposed that governments are going to bring up new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come to the country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> country by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> was imposed by a platform that <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a large amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities, to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you cannot go and pick all the current residents in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of the technologies like <unk> standards for <unk> and usually it's the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent me a bond with the <unk>
He showed him to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a very abstract discussion -- and at some time, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be held there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to make this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country gets forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site to measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very severe and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be able to be able to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from developing countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them that they will help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all be confident to be involved in the <unk> so that they could all be trusted.
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
I could use a thousand square miles.
And a little bit later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to interpret their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special field regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the organizations in society, <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, passed over again in other voting voting -- <unk>
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in city construction.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea <unk> it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years and getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> it's the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and then allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders, of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave their family back to their family to go and get labor, sometimes are mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to you to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to you to think about insist that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to do a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I got more recently, photograph and publish my blog and colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothing is <unk> <unk> markets.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My look at it is <unk> and buy it becomes my search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I love color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
So going back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I would think about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you do with somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I want to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as a woman walking around at TED in underwear.  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see you for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you are going to tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the boy that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'll explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't see you <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth about six words for you: The golden <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I have tried over and over again, when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give the whole thing.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things back there.
I don't need to make it <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be a completely intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them took one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need quite a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
And a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that it says that one thing can be just one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, they always get away.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar was taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, they play with these strange tiny particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really rare -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point I was in the physics -- a few years -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow all of the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
So what we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's found in the center.
And then here we make a very big approach to the small metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal, a way of springboard and that <unk> <unk>
And then I did this almost the same way you could do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
So for the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this little little little machine <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable that is being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up and do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on the side and the heat in the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then you get a <unk> and pulled a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then you bring it to a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. and the way it was <unk> was like a breath in this way -- as a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And then we give it a smooth chamber, we were able to make it <unk> and I don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
Over the rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal piece and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights up and we look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And so 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
And so many of the stories and stories, they would be treated with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story explains simply on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
We better have to show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done since the launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around every museum as well.
There's the gallery center, at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around, and you get off.
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open up the front plane up, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall.
Okay, let me go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, you click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm just going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured what we call the technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I began to play, and I met something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to pull the picture, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find some details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this <unk>
It goes up and the truth of it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you a <unk>
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just <unk> around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, even they don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, you have to do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, <unk> all the children in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the year races in the last two decades.
Some of the time ago, if you wanted to win a career race, one, take a budget and take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you earned the race.
This is what we can in engineering, it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic electronics.
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the Earth's cortex -- but it represents 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it is as if almost all the existing atoms were <unk> and <unk>
And that's changing the whole interaction that as humans have with the foreign environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that he was told by the end, he took the hammer and he threw it up the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in <unk> and he said back, <unk> non <unk> -- and he said, <unk> non <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer, in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup on the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and by the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
And so early there are people over here and there are <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
We asked people a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She got Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, the Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its change through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, put it a label into the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
This is from <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things and there's a lot of air transport.
But the other thing we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we just <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> it is still still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and so many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is driving on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came to us and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how do technology matter how technology can be -- you will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and a <unk> vacuum valves that open up and <unk>
It creates as a curtain of water, with water.
If you fall out of the pixels and write on them, show patterns, look, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building at the entry of the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates and no windows, but when you come up it opens up it opens so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is disappears, like this.
There will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down and someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've got it, but when almost all the architecture is gone.
This is how it works.
You see the people who are looking at the inside.
And here I am myself trying to do the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opened to let me happen, but a building that kept doing cuts and holes, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like that we saw earlier, that moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this <unk>
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or a normal thing, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, different types of resolution.
And then all that could be able to be a cloud of British pixels to which you can reach, and look at them and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, it looks like this.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of mine today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their motions in 3D and use it as entry to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It is so <unk> 3D in real time as a movement.
It can break the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a farm of <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go from the digital world -- we can move from the digital world from the power to the physical world.
In our case, this may want to be used to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover above.
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go out there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I said I told you that, with just about changes in your genes, you might be able to improve it for more and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in the best way, will be stronger resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and confident of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that I would tell you.
What do you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are saving creativity?
Hands up, let me see.
<unk> probably must be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel pretty well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk>
But if they effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it is just the past, or the future?
Does the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, fine at one end, is of course the most interested.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees, about six or eight million years.
There have been perhaps 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like the human insulin but it's the same protein, which is what it comes out of the pancreatic
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut -- more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you raises the <unk> you think about <unk>
And the gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm warm inside, which is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that may want no effort to their part.
It's really like a quick step for bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush to the output.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of funny.
That's us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental to most of the existence of life, in organisms that each cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when <unk> organisms appear to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death on <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every single time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that we still lie in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door from hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a little dancer.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the objective of the <unk> not necessarily only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily bother longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smarter
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in <unk> yet have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at that go ahead, to phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, in the first place, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and taken out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we have <unk> and we were so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation, to have the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that we have a evolution of traditional natural type, root by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species -- distant planets are going to exist there to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society for society, but it's what you pick up individual and familiar.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex in your body, but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In 2004, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs at a low cost to 20,000 dollars and in a week.
There are not a lot to be a lot of the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more and more of all.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us themselves, but they're going to induce any other virus.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against the flu flu in a plant of tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate your diabetes, to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> better memory.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe in the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust.
This is the kind of question we have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds scary.
Well, I had a <unk> seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about with flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words I've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with a flight.
I was able to see it in your eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned it all changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never danced.
As I thought about that later on, I got a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'll just set it up.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as the George Washington Bridge was not much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time I was going to go through things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I don't try to be <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please do that."
I don't want this to be <unk> on 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I grew up, I had the sense of, Wow, die is not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sorrow <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
One month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little small.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I understood those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your airplane -- and please don't be so -- but you can imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that we are expecting you to still do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would it change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the coolest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after I run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis in it.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is a little bit intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he'll be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important to be important and you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're going to make it with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed up a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to go?
I met her with his brother and his father there at that very precise moment, "All right, this is what Tony Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that someone who has both on your inner cannot <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer to draw about that and they record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on its <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One is, we touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that we could put it into a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is it <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the corner of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and the kids and I, we moved into the back garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid, and when they finished, they would have taken the frames out of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to go to the <unk> ride and my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
It's a couple of liquid sun sunglasses that we bought in the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper copper and <unk> and Radio Home <unk>
We took a camera -- we put it together -- we put it up on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one, we release the code -- the software is low in a <unk>
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming, sessions from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system of its life.
We ran to bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall on the outside parking spot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot so we feel like we were looking at graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to me and get me out of there and get me out of there so that I could get it.
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to make them faster and robust.
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized that one of the greatest <unk> of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles, there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible as possible as possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with computer recognition technology, I just recognized something and I would be fascinated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that we all want us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like we have to do. If it's not right now, I think, and if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in <unk> in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a bit dangerous.
I went to <unk> hard.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
In the areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- a lot of fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career, I've been <unk> in terms of horrible situations with the only objective of trying to look at social questions in ways that <unk> attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see handy and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of them on Twitter, I offered the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content I might look at the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when I do it.
But I said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked him a year ago, I couldn't have a chance of certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be done for something that hard or as dangerous as we enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tried to make product <unk> marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> from <unk> marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, at the end, has a brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the X-rays.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more by <unk>
Was it <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X marks on the title, but we're going to make sure that we will make sure all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe <unk> a shoe and becomes the most cool shoe you've <unk>
The biggest car that you've driven in "The greatest film ever <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> from "The greatest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The objective of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to be the meeting with them, but it's definitely worth convincing a couple of big headlines.
You know, you know that you know, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to go out and look at a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film to be I?
JK: Both of the things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where I will go.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies were all gone.
None of them want to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present that product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to have that new <unk> vehicle that's going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> way Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line, maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians -- the <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to what it really changes is changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare path rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> story.
We want it to make a story, but we want to make it <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie -- and there he is he looked at me, as I used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
Is that your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take a proxy and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to hear suddenly -- and I began to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends who make big, giant films giant and others that make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies have so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody in a interview with somebody I can tell you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you get you <unk>
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
You know, the type of smaller movies that we have -- we are more good at a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like that, you know, to remind you to people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: top.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you get in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you fresh change, more <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man of the street, the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: To revive the <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors and things like this.
I usually wear accessories like sunglasses, and I like the <unk> and I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand of a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: And part of the <unk> partly <unk> in part <unk> -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They were getting toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out of FedEx because I hate <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to make a brand of it, but I often lie in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that we <unk> as the people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come home and start in a place and in my case come in and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: That's how I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that give us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
So a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> Have you <unk>
I don't have to be scary. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness for all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were looking very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are just going to be involved in one of their strong points, or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not allowed to avoid fear those elements -- and you actually give them to accommodate and make it become something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are it?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and ethics those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand, which is your <unk>
If you ask you to give you your identity of brand, your child's personality brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary and bold or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> -- dominant magical or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
You're conscious of yourself as <unk>
You're -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're good, stable, familiar, sure, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would not have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they're now using MRI resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as well as a movie for the movies.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned advertising in the open.
In the entire city over the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into the schools of available problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest response or the ones that I've been most successful are the ones I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no good interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of thinking about the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They succeeded <unk>
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
So ultimately, this movie has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies we talked about with their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take it if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees at risk aversion at risk is preparing all of your company to reward them.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
They hate fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
And more than ever a bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for businesses around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> entering the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
And when we started researching it, six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes <unk> these control systems.
And that really struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they went very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking for the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that site.
If not, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better be able to get the goal up.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> on two bombs -- a small one and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed by people who obviously had the entire internal information.
You get all the points for them to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language of <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at initially was calls of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need our theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
There are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant, and the <unk> plant of <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I saw them in an effort to get their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely by data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you cannot <unk>
I started to look at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better enough.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of stages.
And guess what we find in <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with each other.
So it wasn't like this.
And the results have been that after several weeks of tough work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would tell one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little little <unk> is taking a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicating with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about the other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really looked at me.
There's the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input input values for example, with pressure sensors and providing <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the great steam turbine is <unk> it must be opening up escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
So what I'm going to say is important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use <unk> technology.
It would be as possible.
And if you made that, you know, what it is <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare for now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> mechanism.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take out and give you <unk> skills or another one that will make users of your wheelchair and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets on in the morning, give you a great force that is also increasing your speed, and help us, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other magnificent <unk>
This is not an idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> <unk> and it's <unk> it will get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or the <unk> <unk> Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can spend 90 kilos for variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to put on <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner -- to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look back now looking at the users of chairs of wheelchair, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the wheelchair, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often -- very young people, with damage in the spine that when their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
And we also talk about the population that goes up quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It's got sensors -- it has sensors -- it has sensors -- it has some sensors there.
It was completely <unk> on the crutches that send signals into board, here on the back.
There are also a couple of batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and the knees -- and they make it move into this soft and very natural.

In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all <unk> movement down.
Shortly as a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the <unk> climbing and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life in future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the chairs of chairs of wheels all of us all.
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a community who has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos <unk>
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives closest to close with.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the jungle <unk> and it's been very difficult to do.
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been coded for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation do you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard by hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the country's life is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans -- they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to set up links and encourage <unk>
And we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots as the same as the same laughter, the dance and the human ritual <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female female who is playing with a <unk>
I think, like that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to success to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's bring it to the maximum game of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, it can be the moments in which it is <unk>
And so fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together together as they behave.
Thank you.
In New York City I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
And when I'm not battling poverty, we were fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are replacing a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on the foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with owner that certainly through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came up to the captain and then he asked him to go and save the dog's owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There he was a lawyer or a <unk> of money, which, for the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live to be alive just because he made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go to the house.
I need it to be <unk> I need fire, and he brings this woman a couple shoes."
I <unk>
It was not exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hallway it went to the fire firemen that at that height of the room or less had finished off the fire and went into the room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my way back up the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house for the house of house where, as he was expected, his treasure. received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house of home <unk> by the fearless <unk> to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached him even a couple shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as my calling as a voluntary fireman I'm witnessing acts of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of grace of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: don't hang on.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get now.
They were eating food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to influence someone.
So I enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the specific block of concrete block
The first blocks of concrete built in <unk> with a very simple <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit used in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings, or bridges one brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
He was simply adopted the block of concrete -- the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world piled around each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete, <unk> the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, one brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally wouldn't believe that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they aggregate through magnets.
So you can't get in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code in colors.
The green is the sun, the blue is the stream, the pink entry and the orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with one green and very quickly you can start making older circuits in it.
A blue blue is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we took this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game -- <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it <unk> faster or slower it just gets this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to go back to <unk>
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given kids to the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does one light in night, or why a elevator door is open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see from paper and paper bottles, we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island designers of Rhode Island, which have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper and said, "You give something something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> canyon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
I took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it comes out as if I was going to find a date, but what really seeks is that somebody has been caught when it's caught up the snow because he knows that it's not very good when it was <unk> fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I was going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city will never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that <unk> citizens with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You keep <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he threw <unk>
If you don't, somebody can do it.
I mean, it has a playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps that last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads in the viral way.
A responsible system of <unk> City <unk> to see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why he asks citizens to protect them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has been <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this is not usually happening.
<unk> acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that they had done by regular channels would have taken at least two and corner about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the law of California that until the moment has two million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot warning for the institution of the government.
It suggests the government better ways of working, not as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way that we address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to build together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that are contribute by applications that are going to make it every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that you put together, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately grows by -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> -- the way we think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone care service and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He joined the official basis on official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, can you open up the gates of the house, put music well and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So good for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile <unk> called <unk> <unk>
We don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this is really, really got this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good evening. Good evening.
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical stuff.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration collaboration, distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology on platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key role here.
I connected to two people.
And I could have connected them with the government services that we need to do, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we will get the communities.
If we call control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people who are <unk> but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will take our values and bring them into our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
This is underneath what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But that's that <unk> which keeps us that belongs to us that we funded as something that we operate in our against. That something else, and in a consequence are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make that bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> from the financial reform project.
That's not political activism that's <unk> activism
And for those of us who have moved to government is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can be expanding <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and he knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average of our members of our members is about 28 years so that I, to <unk> I'm a major generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to share, they're going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem they don't care about making your voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up, a <unk> taking away a bucket of garbage that has a trash inside.
Of course, we were able to have cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are as <unk> digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, not only we are the government consumers and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be able to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons and prisons in death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in every conversation in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery in slavery as well as I saw the world.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was little and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I felt so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> he was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying that no, I got married again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and I was running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I initially thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went up and went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget.
And he took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, I'll be <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to tell me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to think about is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to tell you that the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want me to tell you, is that you will always do the right thing -- although the right thing is going to do it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that they never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother for a greater year and a sister a younger year.
When I had 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You know, <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And I went up with the strength of force and <unk> "Oh, it's not being thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get to do things that you can't do it.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been stuck during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that we were, according to it, we had <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 billion.
In America, we have the biggest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people on parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail, are in prison or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty. If you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth which affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger is making us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states will give you any rights for always if you have an <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right as a vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before it <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where death sentence was sentence to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility to come in.
We're right now in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense we have helped to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crime, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified this is innocent who is innocent and liberated from the death row.
A error, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation wouldn't it ever allow me to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history <unk> I talk about slavery to you.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The terror terror was what defined its lives.
Now there are people who come to me and tell me, <unk> Stevenson, you teach talks, makes you <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our collective history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what it means we've done.
All of the time I went to each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people could not overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty talk.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's very worrying about listening to what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and <unk> we started to run the <unk>
Let's get on this.
How would we be going to be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
It fascinates us the technology <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so deeply <unk>
With innovation, with creativity. It is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I believe, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related with technology and design, which allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, inequality, injustice.
Now I want to imagine that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together simply to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I was called me to say to me, <unk> comes the <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and do it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I know I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me my idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and when I finished and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of <unk> <unk>
At the time, Ms. <unk> got me up, put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is superior to the worst we've ever had.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> so <unk> we don't judge us by our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society is not because of the way they deal with powerful people, powerful and <unk> but because of how they treat the poor, they sell them to prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do too much force.
<unk> tired, just like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my age of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were given to them as adults as adults are.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge come to someone in what is not it?
The judge would take it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> a tiny, black poor, black.
I began to work on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 black customer to be treated as an privileged white <unk>
In the <unk> I put out there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it; he had sent them to court.
It took about two months, I was already forgotten before.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go through this case stupid.
I got in the car, and I was really feeling truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. I walked back to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "I'm <unk>
So I approached me and <unk>
And I was inspired by the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to audiences.
When he arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I <unk>
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was filled with people -- all grasses, because we talk about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I was able to see the <unk> which was going to be <unk>
I would look out the window and invite you to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with concern, <unk> walked in the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was a <unk>
During the break of the <unk> he showed him, because the <unk> had come in the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this audience to tell this young woman that keeps her view on the target with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We can't really be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to be an effort to take care of the funds that are being spent on policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide in homicide in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they were going to take these funds to make the law, to safety.
I think there is a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> Actually the rate of <unk> has remained relatively stable.
The large growth in <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong War on Drugs.
That's why this rise is dramatic in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of that punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, small crimes against property, rather than <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to make the victims of the <unk> and not less.
I think that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> This is just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media would prefer negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, <unk> to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's a blood -- <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress conducted in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has become more than <unk> the average income per capita income has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy spent 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today, in America, many of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of technology -- this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the end of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels, and the food, digital medicine and the food, the digital medicine and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the
I mean, how many of you saw victory at <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays out with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, in TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> it's about creating a life of as possible.
It's about taking that out that it's little <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> ate with covered with silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with covered <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most precious metal on Earth, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth's mass of Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up for oxygen and <unk>
But then there was the <unk> and it made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
This analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out that Voyager Voyager pointed out to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, I gave me permission to show me your technology called <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water per day of any source -- saltwater, seawater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence in which I will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation because of this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of the moving world in the end of 2013.
And they said, <unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that nobody could have predicted that.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video images, and music books and music, technology of diagnostics -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best of it comes to when the health applications go.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to take these technologies into a mobile device with which he talks about, and because it has <unk> they can collect blood of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there's no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is about 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device added a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the health care and, in the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What about <unk> What wishes <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education in the Academy of Academy to Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you provide for three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 dollars?
And if they are contributions we cannot <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal of course, they can do things that were <unk> things that before they could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined each other, and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better folding into proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take on the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates the shifting of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 seconds, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had gone down in half.
You get to the five inches.
It took a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
<unk> development was meant to impose in the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat is pretty ugly, it's called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we conducted studies in southern China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we did there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny things about <unk> remains that they're fish of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
He wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to get it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they have never fish.
But it is no <unk>
We need the world, but we don't remember it.
You know, the starting point of starting a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, and we have some <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images to start in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the hint of changes.
And by the end to keep a few <unk>
And that, as much as we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting the people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a health care of great fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
We have few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way of it is not the way they would expect the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the science scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From the enormous role that you can accomplish a protected area.
Because with the protected areas, we actually <unk> the past.
And we <unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone and they can benefit from the vision that you can actually erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West -- for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Area.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why they were <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing I give, is it <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube in a professional fashion.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed to be very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us or our actions, it takes out to a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
There are over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, only one small percentage of them is making viral gets infinite from visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of participation communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the rise of the last summer.
<unk> I wasn't saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this nagging <unk> to the very popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present new and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.  You all want it to reach a week, the weekend.
<unk> of Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday day.
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators are having a point of view, and they share it with a broader public, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great inner house then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 pounds of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year they saw him about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a <unk> version that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up in the Internet of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then the international made.
Suddenly, a whole community came out of <unk> which made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all become part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What if you could have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up with a minute, just that only one only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who had protest against <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> not by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly through the <unk>
KA: Thank you very surprise and its humor, Casey Casey <unk> got five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all of the new things we make in creative form.
And all of this brings us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Bieber <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a bit of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics that are just the current means of today, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by unique hope and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been fully in vain.
The words, for so much time my friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not going to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been devoted to a task -- the escape.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was <unk> to the sea of <unk> ship vessel.
All of the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk>
If we first came up, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were fooled by the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to start for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the air platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried to, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants in the population.
Unlike the middle class unlike the existence in the middle class -- whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English -- <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't you mind what was supposed to do, which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs in middle school, one to hide in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> on the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were telling us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition transition and <unk> and <unk> guys trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created by centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the ultimate <unk> student, relentless <unk>
On the other, he was <unk> in lives of <unk> generous lives, drug abuse, and isolation.
But many got help through the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of me, I was elected by the young Australian year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but its roots not <unk>
As a resident <unk> <unk> I was now named <unk> refugee and social activist invited invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got into the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "What do not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to do, living on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a career race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's fine to be an stranger, a <unk> new on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was an energy there, an organic optimism -- a rare mixture of humility, <unk>
So I kept on my intuition.
We had a small group of people who have a slogan that cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
We didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that everybody <unk>
<unk> up to well at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there was <unk> and an adventure <unk>
Before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to <unk> and take the cause itself, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
He cannot prove to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in 1942, when she died.
And I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body.
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They've not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life came into us now we can see that the men that would have come to our lives have been <unk>
The defeat had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of an easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, diving bold in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is right here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the Red <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and break into the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior prince was <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
We now do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that's a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little more than <unk>
I was telling me this idea of losing the ability of enjoying and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford to get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> silver <unk>
And this part of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and a luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out.
We embraced our inspiration.
And so I was shocked, I came to this technological world to see how to make magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that could connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
You put out the text with the picture, animation sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that give us?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which is led to me.
My little little girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but <unk> <unk> to those ideas that children <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps of it.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important thing for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary and a contemporary thing.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor people have been stuck in the camera cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child child <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get back this ritual, to childhood we have to go out and in a chapter, and we had a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "Today I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on and through augmented reality and using augmented reality, it sees a group of animated plants that appear on the interior plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and pull it up to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature will be associated with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It monitors the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects were <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
How can we care?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of the biggest problems -- or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they would fail since we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale, it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get to me, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time that it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that like that, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can try to move to the people of their chairs and together develop some activity of their own health control.
From the next week, it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were working from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they provide their doctor, and share with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, go back to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with you with a video video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where these machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains,
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> please look at it, and when it's open, because when it's open, because sometimes you open up at <unk> office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to give them globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And also, I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be diagnostic services, or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're pictures that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my first passion of drawing but it was a little bit different because using the camera the process was in my planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
It takes place like this: a building on a very <unk> road construction.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
I mean, you have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What do you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three perfectly <unk> objects something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic it looks like realistic that I don't even know about the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine pictures that are very important to <unk> because otherwise something looks bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not quite special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make the impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect reality.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that is going to find out because you don't need to put in danger of the ideas that are in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea of winter I knew that I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made red the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic result of it that I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures that result can be very beautiful, and it can really be <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took out of a folder here.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details, but the general look like that.
This is an analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every single step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something strange here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I write about paper.
Why do we bring technology into technological scales.
The answer is that if I draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to look at the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if you think about something like this, it becomes a <unk>
If the transportation technology <unk> as fast as it was in <unk> tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development, that every few years adds of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves -- we see it not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
And we had one of two things.
Or it will be done in a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is: what is that new way embracing the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's what we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
It happens to make a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition can be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a huge sterile rock, with many chemicals that we <unk> around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized us to give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this thing, and that is, at that time, there was a bunch of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those strands of oil had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a certain sense, those were the more <unk> cell forms those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you have a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
And in fact, the drops that in a way will be committed to being better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals together, and they get more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and a very simple -- but things get interesting when these <unk> learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow, that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order for <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did only by <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the safety folks at the airport.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and cut it down to 22 times.
So if somebody wants to want a hundred million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of them for all of the guys in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus and would have spread that through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells are happy to be <unk>
But then another big step happened in which things got very different, and that was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form cell communities as well.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of mite-resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication has taken place that in a way, they were together in that -- and set out a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful -- all the individuals of that community would become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point occurred when these communities were approaching so much that they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without your heart, or the brain cell or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they were not doing more than process in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat any fruits because he knew bad and sick for the last time ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit with the deaths of the dying.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information accelerated that is enormously an evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now move through similar periods of similar organisms -- <unk> our data methods, and presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
So the computer <unk> the <unk> video tape, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was taken by a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language, and so on, took less than a million years.
And again, as the electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
And the process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job jobs would not be possible without recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to engage in a conventional way.
I don't know that it makes every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that it doesn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all these programs, and take those things that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, put these numbers, so none of them.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better do it.
You get those and <unk> the rest of them.
And now I <unk> the best of the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> on an analog process, analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will destroy the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
Let's give some mutations going on.
And it tries to try and do it with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that sequence numbers absolutely perfectly.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried <unk> to see how they work.
These are odd programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security of the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and she gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different processes of design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices as well.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of analog organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what is coming here.
But now it comes lunch and I think we will stop here before I get <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for me to give up part of my false <unk>
Before I was dealing with my talk, we talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide World is.
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that we would pay 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tried to push the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that's someone than 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> -- as the legendary Ted Williams, the last conductor of the League of <unk> on <unk> <unk> in a regular season.
Now I'm going to show that to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
So imagine you have <unk> and they belong to a surgeon who has a record.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear self has two clogged arteries and his family doctor sent it to a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's very much getting better at this year.
And your hits has been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think should be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending me to the world, and I am, with the mandate to be perfect.
I never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> studied until a blood test.
Such you.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the General <unk> nurses in Toronto, not far away from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, the origin of the origin and the <unk> of the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated from <unk>
And I read from the medical school with the impression that if I <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing to all of it, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I was working.
At that time, I was assigned to <unk>
And the emergency room I requested to go to a cardiologist with me to go to that patient.
I would report to the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions that heart stops going and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about.
I gave <unk> and medication to relieve pressure in her heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could actually be able to get out liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't hold the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would take constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inner voice that was like, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that I asked the nurse that I was signing up to Mrs. <unk> who is well if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he wrote the high and the ambulance along with the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. At that time, I did something I don't do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency emergency service on the home.
And there is another nurse, not that <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most doctors in the emergency emergency.
Other specialists who fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And then she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him high and suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I was just breathing and blue.
<unk> personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then that <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never danced.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they went back to what was happening.
And at ninth day, they let him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was inspired by that and I experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just alone, <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make the peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure that I would get things out and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made such a <unk> mistake.
Why chose <unk>
And slowly that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day, <unk> opened up, and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I had the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to make any more mistakes, I would cease to cease those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was teaching in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him into her home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my chief asked to talk to me in his office.
And he made the three words: remember you?
It reminds the patient he saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can Google Google -- it's an infection, not from the throat, but the upper top, and that it can cause the close of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You read antibiotics because it goes <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times on the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, and especially working in a hospital, because it got to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't give them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
We had an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out that a colleague who was checking the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, and he called the surgeon surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I had a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and when I noticed a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, he called the surgeon.
Both were operated on and they recovered well.
But every case was <unk> me.
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't get and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for not the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, trust me that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
<unk> denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get to medicine to the people who make mistakes, we're going to be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and errors to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the Toronto Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs that are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian people die, by medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is just spread out every two or three years, and we don't care about.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain <unk> <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, suddenly, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always as well.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, I won't get anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students are <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You know, I could say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and you know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would raise their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We have the errors of other people not with the intent of <unk> but in a loving way and a loving way that they all are <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans are running the system, and when this happens, they will make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I memory.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick in an average American, are about 70 to day.
Not long ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are driven by these executives and the time that we need to make decisions related to those assignments.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> work a week.
<unk> every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we grade the way that we deal with those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choose to pick up your options.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
And as I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I am blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive enough, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this supermarket <unk> at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> <unk> and this was when we took water from <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked, why I never buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
And I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "You know, let's give this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists who came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
He took a place for <unk> right at the gift shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 and 24 different flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I was <unk> a 60, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
When I stopped when I had only been <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
If you had six, there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were in 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we will probably get rid of <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the choices of choices are really affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, from a few 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program will <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as tall as they wanted to.
And in the plans that were offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people are going to be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
What is most likely to do is it <unk> the decision that <unk> even when it goes against the interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> although objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that gigantic variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for so we can contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
So today I want to give you four simple techniques that we would engage in one form or another, in different research, so that you can rehearse in your business.
The first is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange choices -- there will be a <unk> increase on sales, there'll be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I just eliminated the products for junk percent of cats -- that less <unk> are increased <unk> by two larger <unk> sales and lower costs.
You know the supermarket supermarket in average offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce inside.
In the world of financial consumption, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better than the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard show.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> automatically to an insurance background.
And those of you really want to choose to, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these choices are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a couple of paid <unk> the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round, that in the second time, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choices that it's <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must be so <unk> very concrete to people.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use credit card cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting in which they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we would love exactly how we had been, we did a little <unk>
What we added is that we gave it to the staff to think about the positive things that you would think of in your lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> across the corridor of the <unk> the magazine can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This scheme of rating is totally useless.
<unk> need to tell you something to <unk> not that the <unk>
You often look at this problem with those huge lists of funds.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think about it, if just a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to make 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to a few four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> 56 colors, many choices.
And what am I going to do that?
How involved you are.
If you get <unk> always the default button in each decision, this is that you are <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to <unk> the default button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the box of changes does not say nothing about the preferences of <unk> interior, we all made us <unk>
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can run more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It is that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice art art.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s in the East Germany in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter and write to the government.
I had to record a piece of text from written from written with the machine.
And so the government could trace the origin of the texts.
If they were written by the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
And in the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this will give us the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser special printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow printed dots on each page that you get in a pattern that makes you one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments are using technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the world online, we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are we <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to win a lot of money, large amounts.
There is really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The American secret service does two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has got <unk> million dollars when it was freezing.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> You don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us will be victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crimes of online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, to tell them, the protests, they motivate them to motivate the opinions, they love laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in online attacks
Those are the three main <unk> criminals that make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that do to protest and the last group are the national national governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or actually, it was.
<unk> the break last fall because of a <unk>
We brought the safety of the site and carried a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with representatives from Dutch government and asked one of the leaders if you were <unk> the death of people because of the attack of <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website for <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority authority.
And they were going to give it <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters based on the Chinese secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company in the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide provide tools for governments to make it to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it goes further.
You get on the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these things like this obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but I don't really affect because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I don't have anything to do.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's about privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
While we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Park.
These are the cows of my father, and the bottom of the cows, the National Park.
National Park has no fences at the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only driver's thing.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to protect them, and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying that they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Park.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for livestock livestock and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped lions see the pen from a distance.
I wasn't <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was close to <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, is always here.  So broke and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that will turn off and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
It takes everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and battery -- the electricity on the little box. I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out to outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how lions look at lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood would have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now because of all Kenya, to scare other predators as becoming an economist.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my own community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and show them how they <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna, the cows of my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and said it would someday be within one.
And today, I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer in aviation and pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows and my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence power -- CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know that it was already invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would think about it, you know, once once, right, and I tried to show you, I've tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: In the foot. Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to take it on every single step that you get to my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> nothing."
And I felt so proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would have spent my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> -- the five members of the family will leave there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At short time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A tremendous famine <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over one million North Koreans died during famine and only <unk> eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more frequent energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photograph of North Korea at night compared to the neighbors.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the edge between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I walk out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But I soon learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered <unk> <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told each other, "This was a <unk> <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America are looking for asylum <unk>
But many can be arrested by Chinese and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Though there were finally released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans did not get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of their world can fit it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to figure out how to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam of income to college.
Right when I was starting to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
And I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to fit it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and talked about the Chinese police officer.
He was asking for me to go and ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and the bribes, my family was released by a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low dots in my life.
I made everything to release my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from South Korea.
I was going and went between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to take them from prison.
And I went back with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told you.
"I'm helping to the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown unknown, a new hope for me and for the people who are going to be able to do it.
And I showed that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I get together in South Korea, to us.
But achieving their freedom is only half the struggle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community in education, practices of the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to stay in touch with family leaders and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance of determining international support.
I'm sure you'll see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast, <unk>
So city planners come together and thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to local L.A. as if this is -- what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> food, fast food, <unk> terrain.
And just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, the Los Angeles South, home from the food places to carry and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring more people out of food than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the L.A.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would try to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I saw chairs from <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I look at <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a sea of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 by 45 to me."
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it over.
I said, "Well, I can do what come me in it, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid paid by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
And the city got me on top of and summary was given to me by saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made <unk> order.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A <unk> order for plant food on a piece of land that nobody else was --  So I was like, "Well, let's get it.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more terrain.
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why doesn't it look like this?
We had a plant to give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up in there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It is <unk> to see what the land can do.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were <unk> to look at the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and look very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Oh my God no, I'm not afraid you're going to be <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how it had affected and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing <unk> the kids will eat them.
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this are being taught -- if you're not taught how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind to you in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see little guys that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are being trafficked from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, you know?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take container and turn them into <unk>
I don't <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
And what I'm talking about is to put people out of the streets to get to know the joy, their pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Did you take them to take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to you to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a large amount of water on the asphalt that you get.
And especially if you're going on <unk> and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, they really close to the cities, we want a quiet road to do.
The solution to that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so all the water from rain flow will flow down the sides and will have a road -- so it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water as well.
Noise also disappear.
Because it's very smooth -- all the noise.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface are out there.
It first a stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so on, and you can harm that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage to this material.
It's a asphalt thing as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and separated from the <unk>
So if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use of steel, of steel, of that to clean <unk> and we can cut out of the steel <unk> in smaller pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
The <unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel to melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are moving back to the surface.
I used to use a <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to warm the samples.
We tried many samples out there, and then the government, really looked at our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So you gave us a bit of a bit of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a <unk> trial to prove this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing on road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the strength then with our <unk> machine and the church and we came back to a try.
We can repeat that many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool the first before I can show you how it acts to do.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at these times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed like my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban had <unk> Afghanistan and made the girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired by a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide books in market bags to look like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, over 100 of us moved in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they are.
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was so lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. They found that his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my raised mother became teacher.
This is it.
It was about two years ago, just to convert our home to school for girls and women of our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating your children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated by our life and she was always scared and I was always going to see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you stop your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than the women of my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged in my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I've been driving on the streets of Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first one and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> in spite of them, even though in front of a opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you their face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to his village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he got to his house, they are the phone, a voice would pick up that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to me.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harming the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and that he sees that success in her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes not a lot, after the retreat of American troops
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were wandering around them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and sustainable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
You never, ever yet forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the timeline of massive <unk> both of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were in the middle, the fall of the regime, they are carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some loss of about 50 thousand dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I wanted, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation towards democracy.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a <unk> <unk> began to organize workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> -- a women's movement leaders, very <unk> and to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> from the selfish policy of domination and <unk>
Eventually, our initiative was violent and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, <unk> the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days -- all the days of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> old mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the official murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and its <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made for a revolutionary mindset more <unk> and it's removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm more here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose badly, we took the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish politics of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than I needed the elections, which is just going to look at polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the vivid representation of the feminine representation of the more than it is to need the representation <unk> and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and I'll call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but they also put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration in place of competition, and inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to be the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans the humanity of the men and women and women and all the tribes and all of the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of it.
This is how it comes to us, "My mercy is <unk>
This is how it comes to us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us will tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a bad question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody <unk> Why is it left?
Why was anybody going to stay with a man who would give him.
I'm not a <unk> no social worker, no master violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just joined Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, my alma mater, my head with a <unk> loaded with <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> love, where it fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English.
I've spent most of my career working for the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> between them and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the country income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is happening to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships and a long duration or a long way in the families, the last place where we'd want or we would expect that we would expect domestic abuse so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who sticks, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and 10th night of January.
I was sitting next to my feet in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the most struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did was <unk> was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and he loved everything from <unk> which was ready, who had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much value for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I left my work and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of physical <unk> and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> came in.
And as far as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where I was supposed to be, had to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept her below the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed these guns to cause the trauma that lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never got my hand, my life was already in danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my mother from my mother and married him with him.
Despite what I had occurred, was that we were living happily forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted to me.
And I was really, really <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice as much as our honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that we <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, they went down to the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to my face.
<unk> followed by a couple of times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everyone is doing is: Why don't you just not <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the city of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killing cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has already put into the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include <unk> even after <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet, we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if he would have got it allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and familiar, and I am here today because all of you would love me.
We have the tendency to engage the victims as headlines, <unk> women -- women who are <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people, it's a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> from men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and their lives their lives and joy and mothers like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that actually I'm a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I got married with a cute man and kind of, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have to have ever more, ever is a gun that is charged with my head in the hands of someone who says that I want.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid, but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a couple of people that are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, <unk> her sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would be able to make the abuse of light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and their family and family.
It monitors his view of survivors as fantastic and <unk> and they have a future <unk>
We had the direct signs of violence in order to be intervening consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call a Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have got me dressed like this.  Fortunately, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to go back now, but find him later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about for 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These days, they are very <unk> less wrong than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater on the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so they don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed everything you thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would take the back and make the hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our senses, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being courageous means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm on this stage.
Because I'm a beautiful woman, white, and in my job sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that you go, Hold on. They're <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know both models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York interviewed every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- that is less than four percent, not white, <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Could it be model when you grow up.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then what I would really say to each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the chief chief of the American magazine or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be model it's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have had your studies, and you have a copy and you have a bunch of jobs to your back, no matter what you want to do, which is, if you want to be president that you want to be president of the United States, but your tennis <unk> Model interior <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures were <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first shot that I was inspired by and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
This is how my grandmother was a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and the magazine <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not myself in those pictures.
These are <unk> of a group of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people will always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many six inches and I have ever use, except the wonderful couple of before, but the privilege I get I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and forgot to take any money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was going to travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> a red light was jumped with red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> an agent of sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
So let's get rid of these <unk> by my senses, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for whatever who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood two and 86 <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I <unk> and <unk>
By researching this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure goes up to <unk>
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you're expecting is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we will.
<unk> is really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, smart and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably the <unk> women in the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation for racial and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have from success and of failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to me.
There were no <unk> or no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even low care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists randomly.
My story begins in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to give us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much the life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a little girl in five years would understand it.
These pictures are much more than displays of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping the time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, one of the travel, we were walking around, when you suddenly stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the subway store that I put on from small visits in previous memories.
And it described to me what had sense to the five years in that same place.
<unk> that he remembered their heart will force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in creating conscious memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
So today, I want to encourage you all to come in the picture, and you don't know how to come up to somebody and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney <unk> as they were stupid dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press with laughter, applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
Don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World which are mainly in <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> of the World World, where we have 16 species.
So why are <unk> they're important -- first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers down to bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria to absorb the anthrax that it was not going to stretch and caused large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where people are not <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk> importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the businesses, and the Under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In the culture of <unk> they're doing very important <unk> to open sky and in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities are using this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically endangered list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel across different countries, so focusing on a problem that locally is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you walk out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors about the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without effort, without the energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
Tell the 21st -- that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would do, you know.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach the people of Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local people.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were excited to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were glad that the local local worms were not nearly agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that I was not going to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> for time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato made to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red.
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought that just we were doing mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the American Americans, what they did the English and after seeing what the authorities were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, we at least feed the <unk>
<unk> will look at the <unk>  <unk> see the waste of waste -- people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist ...
The book was published in 2009.
We, European countries, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries will <unk> and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I try to deal with all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said because of all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This was supposed to be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. <unk> opened up this conference on the ground and said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do that?
It never comes to a community with an idea, and he sits down with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a cafe.
We have zero infrastructure infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person is to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important growth.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important one.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once to get to a community to tell people what to do, why not at once, for once, but not in their community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to your public meetings.
What do we do? We work on one, and we work face to face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor from the company, your family doctor who sets up with you in your house, on your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this divine <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 online projects, and the government came to me to see the question: "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
I'm going to get me down, and so the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk> company.
The planning is the kiss of death of the business of <unk>
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you for this, privacy, it has to be great to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people and <unk>
What are you going to show you more of this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils -- not renewable power, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's a lovely story that in a long-term magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered this group of people, and I <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move into the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> they were <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic companies -- <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you absolute <unk> <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing company, and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and look for money.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 world's icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
No word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone made for you, what someone made about this <unk> somebody who will ask you, what will it take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to make our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't want a lot of knowledge to share the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, for centuries and I trust a city.
It has always been supporting music.  There's a show in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most <unk> properties of the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought about how it might turn into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot of people in death and I thought a lot.
And it made me a profound gratitude for the life of time lived and this.
It gave the most significant things about my current life.
But let me just keep this in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up by day and forget how important to one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day, the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die -- I want to be <unk>  Before I will die -- I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they die -- I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die. I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they die -- I want to <unk> once more."
Before I die. I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before they die, I want to be completely myself."
This space has been <unk> and the dreams and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about supporting reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people that wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the education center, we made a kit, and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions that's increasing, it is more important than ever, to find ways of preserving the perspective and remember life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that would give us more power.
It's going to think about death of our life.
Our spaces shared can reflect better what matters as individuals and community and more media to share hope and stories and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
It doesn't speak, but it transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It shares <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When he sing songs, of our childhood, I was trying to say words that I could not even be <unk> it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high.
Do the <unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and Lady of Lady Lady
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they don't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which was autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from that <unk> so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the developmental disorders that faster is increasing in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't look very interested in myself.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars together around the room, looking around the room, looking at the machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As it was growing up, it got more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that it's things I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you might not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their interior and, honestly, the search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be the others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications professor, which would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of the truth of these students with their great minds, their great books and their large <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have had sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a huge communication.
We need desperately a huge communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are those who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the midst of the health and health care environment, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
So first of the question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that I make them dumb to.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything as straightforward as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate clearly their science without compromise with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- and they are kind of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do they do the <unk> bullets are killing bullets and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows than the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the single design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- so that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we will provide graphics that supports our other senses and create a more profound sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key things that you can help to do that we open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all media, filled with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford of English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for an audience with no matter what was <unk> platform, platform.
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that they said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had the courage to face them, and eventually he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington -- their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the United States <unk> <unk>
Not quite <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen to be chosen by a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of it, because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for if he did know him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that you have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President's invented the title. There was already existed before, but it only meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And that's why the Senate becomes <unk>
They said, <unk> <unk> we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with an awful degree and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate did not exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama has kind of going on there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to stay waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to warn you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads in the world, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of wireless vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have moved to the title of <unk>
So that finally won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, exactly the appearance of the Senate, -- well, it was <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to do with it.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the <unk> so much more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land on an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap firefly worth of light -- she tied my head through this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that subway hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and dropped 2,000 feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole and their lives without any reward and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Prize.
Among all the incredible people I met there I met <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not just to use it.
When we finished talking to me, I felt really bad, I was honestly to ignore this <unk> of our days and thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me kind of stick up your stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them would even look when my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk> dirty ones.
A conservative calculation is that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during the whole slave slave whole.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> 50,000 today.
And yet, today you can enslaving entire families for generations by <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promise of good education, and better work to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost the world and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I knew the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, men, women, in fact, families <unk> in a heavy slice of <unk> mechanically <unk> bricks in their heads, and the lead of blast furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no battery to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> would be quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera turned out too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You know, <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not the citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they are already were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and to work within the system for his liberation and trusted that I <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for a mile per <unk> terrain until they were waiting down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who get charge and kids would stick them into their heads with leg belt, made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they burnt their homes.
When we hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, they advised me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had previously been done.
I was driving up a little stairs, that gave this clean basement, <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local.
They have small, private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls, and a few of only seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and dirty identified by a piece painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From the <unk> I remember making sense of an <unk> <unk> and in that minute, I could barely imagine what to be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no window enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, as we touch a topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, <unk> at home service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves are sold for.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families in the trade of silk trade.
This is a family student.
The hands of black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake lake.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, and it makes sense right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced them to work extensive and extensive in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> the subject that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and kids, and in fear, it's thrown into water to unleash the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of her love it's not going to flee and, as the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they broke the last networks, but they had been working from one one of the time.
On the winter night and <unk>
And we can actually point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi <unk> in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorbikes suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to take it through a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would invite us to get out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed at this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we took out the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour when we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of them, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, they were <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out the pump were <unk> on their own sweat.
I remember looking at his tired, tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy heavy bags of stone that then they will be transported to the other area in which they were holding the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the side, the margin is going to work at other <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of being disease and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying, his uncle, <unk> I inherit the debt of the uncle what force is being a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in mines 14, and the leg injury that you see here is the product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it must be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he would be liberated and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in face to a much respect.
I want to throw light out of slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give witness to them and that we will do everything to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images aren't magazine about people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I have had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images take a force in those of you who can see them in people like you, and I hope that that strength will turn on a fire and that that fire, sunlight about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there is a peculiar problem for who <unk> are like the management player.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the human activities.
We were telling us the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demand degree by extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders as Parkinson's Parkinson's as Parkinson's disease destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was an ballet ballet ballet dance.
Over the last few years has been moved on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we know whether there is a cure to be when we have an objective metric and an objective metric and <unk>
But it's so frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no <unk> so we don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, you never do it. It's never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could make those ourselves?
They wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
And so what I want to refer to you as a conventional form of <unk> you can see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds to speak, and we can imagine as a speech dancers because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary education.
Let's think about the time it leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as it looks, and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
And in the plot plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> from the elastic ropes.
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials are <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also testing tests in voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're free cost and we all know what happens is happening.
And when something takes a cost so <unk> it shows mass scale.
These are some incredible lists to <unk>
We can reduce the patients from the patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for the arms through routine.
With high <unk> we can get positive data.
We could do a massively massive recruitment research for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's disease Initiative to be <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have a <unk> accessible lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, we can call it under a price and give recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you. 
What will it take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease or the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not <unk> you may not <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a accuracy of accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we do is we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I would <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were moving in the dark, in rooms with no windows and we generally avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin, even more perfect -- we make it possible and take care of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and a real taste of the images and the picture.
On March March 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was voluntary -- there <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave of the wave.
The level of water was recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took off the mud and let the house ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish dead, <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
And for weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of pictures and cameras and punch cards.
They all did the same thing.
We were going to take them to different places of villages around <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had <unk>
While fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean the stall, <unk> bathrooms together, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had over a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook, contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the child was supposed to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came to be lucky as a little bit of photos and it took more <unk> so I went back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were reminded of <unk> a village neighbor to north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of time with time agencies that were <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could take an hour. I could take a couple weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw on the hand using a guide and the areas that the color and detail had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> out of bacteria, with algae, with algae even oil, and even with the course of the time I continue to get rid of the time I was <unk> by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean, dry and had been wiped out by his <unk>
We were lucky to hand.
We have the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures already <unk>
As he said once <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were kind of <unk>
He had begun to <unk> her, but he stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face was not <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and the <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The tsunami from the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close walls to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small children, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that they were all surviving.
The day I gave her pictures his younger son was about 14 years old.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them were helped to clean up the <unk> of <unk> photographs, the great majority of them -- -- the vast majority of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 hundred and hundreds of bloody photos and <unk>
Over this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> and material and material -- most ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One photo is a memory of somebody or something, a place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing to look for.
So this was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone with the connection with the past.
When a picture of this comes back to somebody, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- I'll get something bigger, using her talent to something that is not 3D models of perfect skin.
So I would like to read this electronic email. He sent Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
And one in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can be able to see after the <unk> from the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without <unk> <unk> and challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and put it into a <unk> of a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package.
And that packet of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet player.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack and put it into this bottle, how they disperse these photons up into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in a <unk> <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
And the pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> pack that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces down inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights in the top of the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a <unk> bullet and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow camera, about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit at that movie?
One day? A week?
It would be a very boring film, a very boring bullet on motion.
And how about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature looks like a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full <unk>
But if you look at this one and you look at this <unk> you realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it keeps <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo to low exposure, it gets very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the ultimate exposure -- so I just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that string of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of that data in raw data and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future is, let me see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light out on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left-hand side, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in the Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will return to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way to the door and also all the way to hidden objects -- but we don't know what a distance.
When you project a laser project you can record a photo in raw, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's on the <unk>
Or we could look at survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows by the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows by looking at the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open windows of the open
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking inside the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualizing to solve the problems of environmental health.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist in art, an art of an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but that we can can can be able to see.
And creating a new form of computational photography and slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves, Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are put away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
So what happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events in the world are sometimes shown to the camera.
We need the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make your life, and you give you free freedom to you.
With a cell phone, a crime of humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
You can record a song, you can record it to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that <unk> in search of a change, they had a phone in your pocket.
Who of your friends, have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, your Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a mobile.
But today, I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This has said that every single mobile company, every single Internet company in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, <unk> priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once once, and I went back to her, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all of the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a <unk> lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, they ran a deal.
We were going to get the demand and send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about the brown one in the inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand and five <unk>
I first saw and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, you can go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they do.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's making society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who he talks to whom, who sent an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, perhaps never happened.
And as a result, no one of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to get them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, you go to your representative that just because companies and the state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company phone phone phone -- what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to give you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
And as a result, I have cerebral palsy, so it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk>
It's not <unk> it can't <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in the present room.
And I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Go for a walk.
Christmas <unk> they're at the shopping center, drive into circles looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And then I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. It's just one of them.
There's no <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park, <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't think of not being surprised.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters older <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters. If my three sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also outside and if we didn't drink all the ultimate note of it, the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five and putting my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> and the campaign.
The people that I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> so much that die of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to graduate school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to happen on the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we would get them into <unk>
On summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> so I was drinking <unk> and I got to get warm cups in the back, I would walk into the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> me and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the University of Arizona, University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at four <unk> When I finally have a <unk>
I have learned <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the time.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater department crying in historically, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask asking for what and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do it either.
It was a role for that that literally had been born and they gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy,
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors who had disabled actors for disabled actors.
And I graduated home, and I first went home, and my first tour tour <unk> was an extra <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> of <unk> not white, with disabilities.
Just give them to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, I took these famous comics from New York to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at high speed by the New Jersey Radio with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that tiny rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> New York City <unk> now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and by starting to remind the management managers, Arab directors are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight against the challenge of <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to be invited to the news show on wire, with Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I were to graduate graduate dance, I went back to a study and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desk of the speaker not to go out moving on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed like I took it back and hit my chair.
Something really fun with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
They say kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and as much as a little girl or higher.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with a comments like, "Why are you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair cannot make <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> <unk> Go.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors were saying they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, it will be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need our whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded "The Children from <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee kids, a tiniest tiny bit of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I believe this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small South <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities -- there are no job, no perspectives of future.
He just lived in a tent, in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gives him a little bit about a man who offers him to <unk> him after dinner, <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present to a young lady.
Finally, the house.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts out a car bomb.
That little boy of that little village with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were in <unk> an organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was expecting an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came back.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of town, the great dream of city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't engage in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in the cities will be under 18 years old.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the violence, the <unk> will be the history of cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They're not doing anything.
I went back last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house some youth leaders in a business race.
<unk> up to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had an idea of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a graduate college student, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to reach from point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the highway system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It began <unk> <unk> to local residents who usually couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story different.
What does this different story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's <unk> <unk> and I think the entrepreneurial spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was reluctant to train some of the young people at the height of the business of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business security.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and even recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic, sent from overseas.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families families, the young men can go together, and as he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
And by the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO to work for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit, is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> and set them out of their businesses.
<unk> the young people with the resources they need to do, they need the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit of business is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its Yellowstone <unk> that's how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation -- and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> in northern New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun made the leaves -- as a <unk> and it's not going to be on the way that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> <unk> in a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls <unk>
And I was <unk> he was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to take out what they had <unk> who thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and I was getting a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, <unk> <unk> tons of waste and two thousand metric tons of products that were <unk> every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a more more more more more more in.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
I will not just travel in our trucks. And I <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical and snow <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one of them <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on that for several years, and their bodies were still moving up to the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and <unk> around you.
They just want <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage to it.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
I think that it seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that <unk> are the most important hand hand in the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of waste <unk> and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from your container and your dangers inherent to make care in very real ways.
Disease we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back to come back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the economics engines begin to fail when it's on the danger of the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then there's what I call our average speed we need.
So I mean simply at the speed of the used to move in the time.
We don't usually care about us, and we cleaned up with us to our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We used them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that we thought about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that maybe you will help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to go?
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
One day after the 11th of 2001, I heard the <unk> of a flood truck truck on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs on the stairs and there was a man doing her <unk> journey as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that I began to research full waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
<unk> waste is what we think when we talk about trash, they account for three percent of the nation.
It's a remarkable scenario.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage out of you, you will give you a moment for <unk>
Let's take a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life being part of the environment where architecture comes naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as an example of my team, and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of us in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the <unk> coating generates heat inside the interior, so we need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it comes to a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, this looks nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a very wealthy place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted by the ancient market that is this open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to survey the site -- which is located in a much large area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the picture, not exist yet.
And it's also between two different streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And it extends with a <unk> <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that was being bent by its own shape, of sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would go to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete concrete concrete <unk> to allow the air entry and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall. It was not what I had.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center -- because in order to get a lot more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but it was also because it wasn't necessary to have <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy power for the building in a city where electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with the meeting and the bars that would create this <unk> city.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collecting water on the inside.
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, their tradition and culture.
And so during that analysis I put special attention into the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen dozen <unk> access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first piece of design that we did was expand the streets -- existing streets by creating 12 early blocks of initial blocks and features in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of these strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we took a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local rules that they set up greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the ground floor.
And I also <unk> this idea of doors.
So the roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving distance to the community, the full space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get <unk> and make activity such as a race of two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people change the communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as an objective connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little bit of <unk> cute <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was filled with jealousy, until I took my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in time after the <unk> of school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
And when the shoreline was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the middle classroom, I took the book grades.
And then I did.
I took up the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of a little bit.
All the way --  And I set up to back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes of everybody, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself a row in a row -- just because I was there, because I got there.
I still surprise me what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from?
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was excited about the reason why I was bothered with this little girl who was so small for <unk>
It strikes me jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would take the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which we are studying them in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> but there would be literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
No Shakespeare.
I was looking at the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost all of them.
This year is done by 100 years of their masterpiece, "In the most <unk> study of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it comes to books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, to their wish, for their <unk> they are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
As storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> make all novelists <unk> and that is something that they were trying to understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> picks up his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like large amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links very well with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony suddenly, listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from your interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth -- a really painful truth, of the truth, the most agonizing the truth is better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- which makes us suffer, causes us to have a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to go and look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> would reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us focus on this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we had to give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a young young man who was being used to the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man who didn't get away in what his wife's go.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, most of us to fantasy.
And because of this reason, I believe, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, I'm going to tell you, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false Facebook account for which they would send <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year. Every year.
She was trying to prepare to the new girlfriend of his ex-steel -- I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge if you change creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very bizarre character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to do our own minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of our fingertips, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in an instant.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to <unk> your self and <unk> from what you've ever seen, and it's under the ground floor, and it goes down to your rings, empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, both as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good American citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not secure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asked by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> who needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we would <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each other of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six billion -- once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to get your hand.
It's one of the few times we see <unk> relocated in history. I think this is so emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as an <unk> problem.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's on the opposite side.
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying girl, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of July Buzz Aldrin jumped out the rubble module. The Apollo 11 and landed on the Sea of <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in gray gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program took 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which went after it went after Armstrong after Armstrong came past the last year, is the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> 50 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice in <unk> a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn in our goal?
And you can also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why play Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon was in a context of a long list of technological fitness.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and just eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to be what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the human history, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo crew flew 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars -- to create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feed the global population seems to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't get to a <unk> tube tube from the rocket.
I knew this kind of the last mission that was <unk> but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks as if the technologists would have distracted us and had enriched with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that we <unk> Intel and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists provide the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment, times that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and development in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you look at it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable sources as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are aware of what policies and international treaties -- the development of an enhanced energy, <unk> increase in research and development growth, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the climate climate that we'll see an entire energy policy of America, or international treaties that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they're not going to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and cycle of food, but there will be famines while there are bad governments.
And finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the real problem.
President Nixon was declared war to cancer, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some extremely resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no science science science science fiction -- how to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned straightforward.
I was just three days.
And I really didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't really miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that you have about trust.
It's so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, is a very generalized belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task -- that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It turns me to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen on others.
I don't have that.
But I can take care of opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's not many evidence.
That is to say, the people who were <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still have a lot of <unk> because nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen, of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What <unk> opinion are, of course, are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are being done when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone told you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've said your question, "Well, I trust a few other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel by a certain kind of <unk> officer or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary school teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we think about the whole knowledge when we think about trust in a <unk> fashion.
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to <unk> the good judgment of trust in something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I tend to get more confidence in what's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
So ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who have their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, it was too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
You're deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yeah, yeah, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But yes, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but they won't be able to get a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that we will take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are being <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to focus on right before we trust.
trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of business professionals, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier for the task to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> than going to be going for <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public and public life, that the accountability system is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing test is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you know the similar examples.
It will get all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people officials are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust -- ultimately, the signature is signature because we give you the yield other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> tests that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes it every day, everywhere, what makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where my socks is saying that I can <unk> without giving explanations anymore.
I take them and get the money, or I get the money, or they change it for the color that I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson at that.
If you become more vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how I <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong breeze against the screen transfers your physical body to the pixel
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs, underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> Sciences of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
And we would get a transparent bombsight with a depth of camera to detect your fingers and your face, now you can lift the <unk> hands into three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space -- it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words or words with the online tactile sensor that there's down every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
So what I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can relate to and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
So we did what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can come back and reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can actually teach you physically and physically and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to start directly to act on us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if you were going to take that barrier, the only frontier that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted it to become engineering, like them.
After he survive the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only an effective way towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of Chinese love.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the radio of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends gave me, but they were kids, no <unk> like me.
So at age 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
Tell me that for the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> I miss <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
Those who were <unk> of course.
"The Good <unk> comes to life <unk>
And it's not <unk> a lot of <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and much better than I want.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading habit <unk>
It takes a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are all of the research fields as the comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not to do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> -- it's fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like or powerless ever.
Having a dream of <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have done.
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the dreams, of where passion comes from.
So even a sleeping dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer at <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw me on the couch my office took off my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class partner had a <unk> as a first customer.
And I was struck by a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move my head while I was doing the solution.
"The <unk> the new <unk> said, Alex, and so I watched her, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, home home has children later, until death goes afterwards.
By <unk> like Alex and I had been <unk>
But soon after, my squad <unk> pushed me to see Alex that I would talk about their life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with the guys under his category, <unk> <unk> but it's not like marrying him."
And then my squad squad <unk> said, "No, maybe it's <unk>
Also, the best time to work in marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were doing, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign connection was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think that nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> your dream removes a <unk> I want to see. It's good. <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments, which shape your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we had.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change out of yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are time to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person that they <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> would be <unk> names <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
And Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> in your head, and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, <unk> really interesting things like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship won't be. I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as a race is before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better feedback from day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some time around the 30, it became the music and all of them began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it doesn't break the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the age of 30 and so many of them starting a career, choose a city, and have two children in a much shorter period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much harder and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize that you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still can't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, showing more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then you woke up herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head over his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I had been talking about with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words, "In favor of <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident <unk>
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of job to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every single man or woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital capital?
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration -- I'm pushing up the exploration that should not count -- which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and he made it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with similar minds with similar minds are limited to who you know what they know how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with whom is coming out almost always comes from the nearest circle close.
The new things come from what they call weak links friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job out of it.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was growing up, Emma will soon anesthetize her family when she has a partner and it exists his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better than the age of 20 or even the 25th and I agree with you.
But pick up the person that you live now or you're going to tell you, when everyone on Facebook begin to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead to do it work or killing time with whoever you would give them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went through that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a cousin who worked at an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend to live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter to me that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
The history of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like airplanes that come from the airport from Los Angeles, coming out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
Likewise, in the same way, or at the age of 21, or even to <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth of spreading all the <unk> who have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your own identity, use your ties.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students in seventh public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I go back, I would give grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going to be so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, that are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is better to understanding students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were doing, as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working on working in neighborhoods really difficult, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, and ask, what about these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
and who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, they emerged a feature as a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is embracing up to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live in life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my <unk> <unk> and then I waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> on every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the clinical tests, even the security results that they felt children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little of the science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How did the determination for children?
What do I have to do to teach the kids a solid <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  So I know that the talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination commonly is not related to whether it's even related to the Olympic measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that it is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
We only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic nature.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of the pages or the newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you could even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting in a <unk> way -- I am <unk>  This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call radical <unk>
These are building blocks for many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As old said, two is company, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person reaches your arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a dilemma, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> de remember, because a loudspeaker tree is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two works together, it's very hot.
Three degree together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, is the <unk>
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> was somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, <unk> <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that I learn is a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind you that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be the Dad are the films that I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie has taken his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of child <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> boy would send a girl who had the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
We had magical shoes to defeat the military generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician is that the most committed characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I made Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
It's only three years.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  So, she was so slid in the room and was struck as a cockroach leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I would have to get it to understand it.
I wonder what <unk>
It would be topics of value, perseverance and <unk>
So I should feel that Luke one to an army for overthrowing the government?
So we got this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you make Dorothy the movie?
In doing good <unk> with each other and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to be <unk> and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital capital F, force in movies for our kids, and so little on the road of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess Princess doesn't give you the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really hope that the credit of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have <unk>
Why stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney Hall at any of you.
But they send a message to kids, although they, guys, they're not really their goal.
They do a great job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend ourselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to be appearing in classic after classic each of them about a child's adventures or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are <unk> a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not being messed up roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comics, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, and in the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else apart from the kid that we like?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and I have very rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie is.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden in the crisis of <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the methods to look at a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular, how many of them believe that they have protagonists of <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen to have recently chosen to Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to deal with this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are tightly <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to make it <unk>
We have tools for our willingness to be <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our kids to keep their power to be saved.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children male children, a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star favorite character was like, you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to engage them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where his work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was looking for biscuits of the sea of the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see.
Yet over the time, I joined <unk>
I started to see forms and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I would see my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see it in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, by the naked sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and processing it using fake, suddenly the place looks as pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time of time called the <unk> <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city that was <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'm going to try to find random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes and using baseball <unk>
So we use data NASA <unk> to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we thought it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists making <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation as well.
Five meters down, below a thick thick layer of sludge we found a dense layer, of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> workshop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones that are used in the jewelry, the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer, of occupation that goes back in the Middle Roman site.
We also have evidence from an elite jewelry shop that shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in using satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the <unk> <unk> probably was written in <unk> four years ago.
Now share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as it looks like, TED was not founded in 1984 City.
Do the ideas actually were actually started in 1984 naming C. In a lost city not for much time and found from high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
Now let's take a group of <unk> obese group on cars.
They're competing for a <unk> race and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide in front of your house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that go on the side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places, the front of the door, the line.
So the <unk> or what there's on the other side of the door, and just look at the quality of the light.
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> the tickle the tickle on your nose.
You can smell the cookie <unk> and you see it's about to get into the mouth.
They went on the side and get in his living room.
You know, in the room, and making the maximum use of imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing about her <unk> singing <unk> A <unk> A <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The land has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len in "The Wizard of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that is conducted in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We had the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
It was <unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England, and he has one of the best <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old <unk> two thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have heard about this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is an amazing English and brilliant English guy, and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of playing playing on national television.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I finished spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember he had a <unk> problem. It's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how close our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a number of treaties on the memory writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed our own.
As we have almost no need to remember, we sometimes find that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> competition is such unique <unk>
It's actually not so <unk> there's <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College from London invited a bunch of memory champions and the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it that it has brains in some kind of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was really not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory memory and the subjects of control over the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI scanner, they put their brains while they were using numbers, faces and shapes of snow, they found that in memory champions to become <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves the space of space and navigation.
Why? Is there something that we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> competitive is managing as an armed race where each year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
In his desk, front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize him in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour.
And while there is a large number of ways of remembering things in these sets -- absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It shows you with a paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that their job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
So what about here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean for you. It has no relationship anymore.
With all the other memories that dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They wear white hats.
They have food.
They were okay when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we went back to that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to make this data back 2,500 years of the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story goes: There was a poet called <unk> who sat a <unk>
They were hired like entertainment, because they had before, if he wanted to give a very good party, it was not brought to a <unk> a <unk>
He stood up, he wrote her poem from memory, and he was <unk> and so soon he went, the classroom was <unk>
They went to everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he'd been sitting on each other.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between rubble.
What you <unk> picked up at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or <unk> or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have the word of our colleagues, and the exceptional spatial memory.
If I was telling you that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet, if you ask them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse music in his lobby, would you be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and look at images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> you think, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the picture, more <unk> will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first treated of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory the same way that I would have done it, if you would have invited him to <unk> you 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous image of crazy and crazy image to help you remember the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And so I will remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it comes in in the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse you, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath from when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was simply fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a dramatic event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone else would take off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing better and more and more of the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really a lot of this thing.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a couple of security glasses covered with just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of one competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve as good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Now, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and numbers on the phone, and this is actually not the point.
These are just just unintended tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights to how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we really focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
We put a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to be laid around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I did -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to human beings in front of us, who walks on our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even think about processing <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, and so we would start just a <unk> place New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I went back, and I would come back wrapped up in a towel -- I all looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
He hated that tour, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of areas, but of those emotional connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about that because we based on a building two thousand thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, <unk> stable, front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got this round thing, has this round thing -- columns, red brick that leave <unk> what <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the values of property, the values of property, the values.
But it doesn't really have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for town, a place to come up, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We cut and we made it <unk> and we did so much of the people.
And all of the black, all of the black, you think we feel really good, but we're dead by because we don't have any other choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with these symbols that are <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we do swing the <unk> to go ahead and over and over again, and we've done it in the last 300 years, of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I took over the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It's about the concrete.
Can you guess.
Small <unk> on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> neon and added a bake to make new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols that we now have -- we have new design techniques -- we have a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few shapes that are attached to other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academics and public critics were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> rise to Bilbao increased two and a half thousand when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms of wild and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the means <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant, culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the major mayors in the world.
So all of you think that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new <unk> country with other star architects.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects of elite in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through the whole architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of consumer consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere -- that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't look long enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know if that was designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the people were going.
That's never going to happen to happen, because we are on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel <unk> or the lift, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the self to media -- it starts to swing faster and faster, so it will be on both extremes of <unk> and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the audience.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional payload of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not only images of a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building built up today, first <unk> to the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
It was bombarded by examples of experimentation of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell you that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using false words, and kind of complicated, and you're not a <unk> public who doesn't have anything to have seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't stop <unk>
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that buildings tomorrow will be very different to buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> of red brick of red <unk> based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings were attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a remote parking garage in Miami Beach, can also serve to make sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Coast of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the surrounding community around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no longer matters if it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the <unk> spaces of the local libraries -- the homes where we formed our kids, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does it in the great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And when couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because although his mom tells you all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
My mom tells me and what your friends or fellow colleagues say, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and asks others please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve worth thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager that gets these answers to one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
It's simply not about privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand is <unk>
This environment, of being connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of feedback that they do.
There's no divide between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what it's authentic and what is really striking digitally.
What is the top of the life of someone in front of what it is normal in a every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
Growth of zero remain dominating our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends are like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the kind of superheroes of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their own studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for our growth as human beings, and how we serve society and the labor of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates in class, <unk> participating in the classroom because they don't want to attract attention to their physical side.
One in five are not going to be attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And at the test season, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you're fine enough, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about how it looks like.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, United States and China.
It becomes irrespective of what these young men are.
So, to be clear, of course, we are talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem of self-esteem is <unk> the academic <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, engage in more diet and not healthy that they can bring to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this because of what they make more <unk> as the drug of alcohol and drugs and drugs -- aesthetics, aesthetics, sexual relationship to early ages and without protection and damage.
The perfect search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have any higher rates of <unk>
Eighty percent of women don't present to an interview interview on one day where they don't feel safe with the way they come in.
Think for a moment what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what is that <unk>
This potential is interest in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, by itself, doesn't take you far away.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are following our children will not only have a positive impact but also an impact impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
And these six aspects are starting to be crucial to anyone who is willing to provide an education in your body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the business, and we are a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of how women are seeing and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to count with the input, our politicians in <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that <unk> or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see.
We all can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When it was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to change our culture, so that our kids will grow all their lives, valuing their individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them out of the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them, where the way they think they are seeing that they have never seen the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> her <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats at a distance. What would it mean if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, it would be <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were looking at it, and we would claim the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> to everyone.
But let's give our kids the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
I would get to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's switch each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we started together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, are becoming insurance agents in themselves in the same morning.
Let's do it.
On the fifth November November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the United Defense League <unk>
By <unk> he was initially convicted of innocent people, but being prisoner by other <unk> <unk> in the company of others, they started planning on attacks at about 12, New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters for the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an FBI informant <unk>
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer with an American mother, an American mother, elementary school elementary school master school, the two did the whole thing to give me a happy childhood, for me.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, to meet.
And so I saw that when people take time to interact it doesn't require much to want to wish the same things in life.
However, all around religion, in all of human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were going to be inspired by their convictions that they think we have to use all the means to use all of the possible media to all live as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the past week, he and some friends had been going to shoot him in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> shot -- that we didn't know that our group was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me <unk> my father helped me hold my <unk> on his shoulder and explained how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot he shot at the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise you, especially me, all the goal on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such as a child.
All of all, the comment made it very often, but just a few years later I understood what they found so funny.
Did you see the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved on 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to be comfortable to be comfortable with somebody who was just time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often <unk>
It was secret to my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on house reading books, watching TV, watching video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to say <unk> -- for <unk> under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
It was fascinated by opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the proof of thinking was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
And one day, towards the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had done friendship, was Jewish.
I took a number of days to go to the light and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly I felt very proud of being able to overcome the barrier that the whole life had been made to believe me to be <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job, in Bush in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures that experience it was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is like to be homosexual but I know what is going to be done by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he turned my figure on a moment when I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how my mother was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever while I live.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and she said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to take the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better path that even though I was inspired by this ideology of violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts of sense, as rejection to the actions of my father.
So with this <unk> I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. The children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all --  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that is projected into their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has color, taste and texture.
It's your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a time of your childhood project you project front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice <unk> in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a movie on the internal movie tea, you and you.
There is nothing that you would get more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness.
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why aren't we just a robots that we have to get out to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, it's an objective
<unk> by nature, it's subjective to subjective it.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, we will look at that vision.
Design was studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the brain -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
We were going to look like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to be <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> about a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations today.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what it looks like.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I'm not <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well not tackles the true central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is an internal internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do the <unk> how the <unk> work is <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we speak, how we talk about, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied with an experienced experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I am an <unk> a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that would work. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a fresh explanation, so we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology accounts for biology explaining a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to fix that idea of our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that initially <unk> mad, before we can deal with awareness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal movie has a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> Consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be famous.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
Well physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> brick space, space and mass.
<unk> laws of fundamental laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic stuff.
On the contrary, you look fundamental -- and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space mass, time, mass, of Newton. So he applied the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept.
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass mass, then by a matter of logic, you have to apply the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the road to create scientifically.
So what we need is that we need to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to other fundamental concepts -- space time, the mass, the mass, physical processes.
Now, physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple as we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, and every system is conscious, not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart.
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when I think I always look at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some substantial sense of <unk> it will provide some primal precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a bit crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
And partly this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental to like space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea is so much less for different cultures -- where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we think of thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex -- like in a human, awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, just as significant as significant awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the <unk> the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of dynamic information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of awareness of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using lots of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, the awareness is that he puts fire into equations.
In that view, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to fix our relationship with nature, and it can have very ethical social and ethical implications.
Some may be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I have to get consciousness, then it must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you're extremely hungry.
I think by thinking about, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in some ethical and moral terms, it's not so much of the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are with a lot of ethical issues, quite serious about the ethics of intelligent computers and the ethical ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical perspective, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to go through the right path towards serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve this overnight.
But I think we finally will figure out it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
It had a very normal, one under profile.
I went to school, I met my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community approached my parents, because I wanted to take it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a obvious problem.
She hasn't really gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater <unk> in my mother, and I spent a long time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 years ago, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
And I said, <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When the people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had experienced with people with disability and inspiration.
And we don't. It is not the blame of the boy, and I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?   Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> to Oklahoma <unk>
It's something wrong with a disability, to make it remarkable.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make a fantastic difference.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you've seen one, of the girl with no hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with solid legs of carbon.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk>
And I use porn porn -- because we brought a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would be able to be disabled in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that have been talking about strange <unk> to express that they think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was embarrassed to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images attached to people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person, is actually a hard thing.
We were looking at some things.
But the things we overcome aren't the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of <unk> that tells us that we are more disabled, because of society that we live in that because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They simply are using their bodies their better their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm luckiest lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall away from --  -- <unk> the clever trick of how to load your cell phone battery into your <unk> battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles at a bit of a pack of stairs, hasn't done it to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are struggling to get up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do we have to see augmented reality and professional football -- with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today you can just answer one of those questions, so please don't get away.
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of play at 160 percent, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> we were trying to engage them with all of their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under a helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
Just a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the field of soccer -- from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from <unk>
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players, and I have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people are.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Good.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a roller Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> out of a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan fan.
When it can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball on the network?
What will be your experience when you fall from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers were <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners look at what people want to look and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> had been put on a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was more quick, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group, and you see their next big play in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing in the ground -- no longer have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
They were to memorize the strategy.
It just goes into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose their parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to improve the game.
How would you be there?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from how high people are down.
You can also get information from the sensors of <unk> and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad equipment.
So your computer computer will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being <unk>
It would be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
They broke the ball and <unk>
We had an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will get you.
It took the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
You get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, however, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed me from every single angle.
This is something to create massive excitement on the game.
So I'm going to try and lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality is being part of the sport because it's too profitable to not.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth by <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth by a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it worth by a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality is close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was brought to me, the southern tip of the county of <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer chose to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much at <unk>
Creativity from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> like that, such that every one of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water hits about 120 miles per hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The people who don't, normally they get into the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method will realize the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches from parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been to before they get their lives.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is at that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer with his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of us who were <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, federal officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the July 22 last year when he got a call from an possible terrorist subject sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official with the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years and had flown up here since New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up two times before New Jersey to try to commit himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could be made out of it, and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kind of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy kind and smart from New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
<unk> parents had a order.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a family member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What do you find?
<unk>
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't be <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like it, because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end up and have this <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> -- to believe that there's nothing that you can do by <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
And I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing and I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty much <unk> but noticing more moments of me really that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> with his father the 19th of January.
He never got there.
And I called the police of <unk> and I <unk> him as disappeared at night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the computer car was down the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be an passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and to walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March March 2005, I wrote a call from radio by a possible person who was possible on the front of the bridge near the north.
I took my motorbikes on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed away immediately, and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half after, I heard about as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
And Kevin decided to realize that day back over that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin went back, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did and you gave him to hope and the other life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the New York events, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
<unk> I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly properly.
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
I really do debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And by the end of it, she writes back to you, <unk> When I visited the General <unk> Hospital that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I knew I did have it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and its depression in the hopes that their story inspire others.
Violence is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite finishing his own pain, sent to me with the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who believe or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually it is achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand in three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must use to do.
Creativity can be prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you get to you in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I will refer to later, when I look at this picture -- I think, did you get it <unk> I <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints of the skin color or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my friends, a lot of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom was, "Why do you always wear that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew so how to fix it.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, actually, it's something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who will take me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I still had a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was going to go through the morning of <unk> and the wardrobe and that night, I won in suit <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among over 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was to Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he traveled to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my application from the green card that could go live to the U.S.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you give you the United States and you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
And she was also accompanied by <unk> in Thailand at <unk>
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the surgery most sophisticated and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was my license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it's going to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had lived his truth, but he turned out to her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And every 20 November, we make a global <unk> by Day.
I am on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood for injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that there is no longer <unk> 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first of all, thank you for all my <unk>
To my own support network, my parents -- I think it's very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't take on it, I took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out, other people don't. It's just your gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all became obsessed with gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the topic that sometimes that task didn't block and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still hard work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies and tribal societies, to parents generally know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who know the daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the National Prize, <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in their country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you're born a child, his birth didn't get away.
It's not welcome because of his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood is, gives you your <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of fun for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was born, his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only sexual mother, but the daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays at home and school admits of his siblings.
Up to the age of 12, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, it was given to me that comes out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that course honor, the might even kill.
And it's interesting that this source code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there is a rule more of <unk> societies which is called <unk>
A good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
You're supposed to be silent and that it accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the <unk> even if they don't will.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if I <unk> it with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> his daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was -- when she was four and a half years old, I <unk> my school.
So you might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in the tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of their identity and his name.
One contribution to school means that he has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where the aspirations of their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be served two weeks earlier, when I <unk> the form of tourist Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was the reason that my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And I would invite you to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've been <unk> all these good values in my school and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
I taught my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights to women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all economic and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
<unk> were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers who were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, I was lifted up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog was offered herself for New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October <unk> of 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I loved him to my <unk> "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please don't tell you."
They get the fair cause of it.
You get your life on the game because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and you were <unk>
Both of them were on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words were going to spend a lot of words for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile, <unk> and <unk> on my face.
I'm going to get good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, is like any <unk>
<unk> when it didn't just work.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's the special thing on my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
So I didn't know what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain, 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a passion passion.
I'm a engineering one.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation
Are you still like smart or not?
It doesn't be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and chemical mixes and try to convince them to stay alive.
I've been saved by recently.
But luckily, I have soul from <unk> so I decided that I would try to get the <unk> dose that there really isn't a map of clear that it would say in <unk>
I began to try <unk> different <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose will dramatically be my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemical dose for an early man, and I was surprised by seeing my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I was believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past have met several types of people, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of it, and just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, and since then I get better with men.
So what I tried to do is <unk> those hormones and <unk> and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my <unk> of ideas.
I think it's almost always looking at pictures, and that became my key reference point -- how do you get those mental pictures that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me, it's simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thinking about <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental pictures, from my mind to the computer screen on the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract your mind?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two major groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image functional MRI, to represent the brain. And you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you saw that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the spinal column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
And in this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the brain in the video video.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they get together, a new <unk>
The computer, using just the scan of the scanning brain information to show what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left-hand side, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to doing this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems of larger resolution, available today, and its resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper stare.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer to that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, including me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- first we have to ask the following thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get larger resolution is with larger magnets -- but this point <unk> magnets only have little improvement on the resolution, not gains for thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of large magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a large amount of effort in MRI was to make large magnets -- right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant solutions kind of brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in radios and frequency of FM radio.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field as it can do it <unk> magnetic patterns structured -- attached to the frequencies of <unk> radio.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of radio radio processing -- we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid of blood -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned, and perhaps even even direct neural activity.
We are capable of putting our ideas into a direct form of digital media.
Can you imagine if we could spend above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible used as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to disease and similar diseases.
We have a few options more than opening up this door.
But anyway, pick one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to make this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay fault.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe to say to some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
Everything I can think is a tough conversation, and although our issues can be <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases, of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- I don't <unk> my armpits I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And to be the slope of my pants <unk> and because I had my head -- I would ask me a little bit -- I would ask you a little child, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And he would have had uncomfortable silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> out inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid in three and ten years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into women's issues, on the table.  I had <unk> Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a glimpse of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took a deep breath, and I went down and my back and my back and my back a four-year girl with a pink dress looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl or <unk>
And then I took a deep breath, again, I started from <unk> around it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and you saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite friend is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all about it. Oh no, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You only know how it feels like an <unk>
That's how my life is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons for what to get out of my closet. It was more difficult to go out of it, but this is the <unk> it's hard not to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared a broken bank is harder than to say that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I'm telling you is harder than to tell your son of five than you are going to do it.
There is no more difficult, there's only hard.
We need to stop looking at what's hard about what it's difficult to do for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our speakers, and we must only feel empathy because we all live in something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may be able to feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made out of a life is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
And I had a horse tail, a horse and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian ready to fight any four year-old boy that would go into the coffee.
I was frozen for fear -- <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my dark head, my gay grenade -- and the moving one muscle is the hardest thing that I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around on purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable launches was in the wedding wedding wedding.
It was the first time that many of them guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my wife and a woman <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our David <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait for desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my hand, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at the time, like they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic it is.
It's like the tough conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any life is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other people have to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct -- just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, they <unk>
If they tell your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate your truth.
I would never be familiar with that.
And some of them may be injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you find yourself in a dark past, you have a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if an underwater can be able to get it.
When I was <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to computer <unk> as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms underlying the intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
First, we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are an alien race that you don't know about all the biology of the Earth nor the neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet will stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I looked at a variety of themes through science, through a number of different disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately fixed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of future future.
Finally, in <unk> planning planning there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, "I have a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. And what you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices on the open force, with the diversity of possible futures -- yeah, even an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to remain <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom and keep the open-ended choices.
And so, having on account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing apps of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production in any system where you find themselves inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, play games, and even making money -- actions, all of it without that they would have been right to do that.
Here's some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a human standing foot, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for professional robotics and human care technology.
This ability for tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of that task model.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, providing your potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and they keep the good connected network.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it is widely applicable in <unk> and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated simulated series of actions, to successfully increase assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have increased applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So back to the beginning of the term of use of the term -- the <unk> work was always the concept that if we were going to be smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, in the first time.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had the concept of the rebellion, attached to the reverse.
It's not that machines get smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future future is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come out of control, rather than the other way around.
Another important implication is the search for goal.
And often they ask me, how do you look for targets and learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom and avoid restrictions on its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded so much our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission at NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
This is Kepler gathered the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother.
Together, it helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
Instead, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest state.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused at a global scale have made our ability to disrupt our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a science scientist or weather, or <unk>
But that I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more looking for Earth-like planets -- more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world shown by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable at the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface into pursuit of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Local companies now provide not only short space flight but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these disparate images, we remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay by <unk> places, compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will come up with a great and sad <unk> and the belief and the belief from some that Mars is to wait for save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
So I like the exploration exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to inform humanity is as an impression that the Titanic captain will talk to us that the party is going to be more late in the life boats   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and land preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the <unk> Enrico Fermi said, <unk> having to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found some evidence of living life so far.
Well, where are they?
Now, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough <unk> to consider the stars, between the stars, they lose the notion of the important of the planets that will protect this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and financial exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table of the dining room, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of mine from Jeff <unk> I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but they certainly have no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, well despite the circumstances, I was going to be able to go.
I'm a neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that your heart rate goes up with your heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in your place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if things are bad things that are going to be a total chance of total catastrophe,
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts did not exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come out and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you can go ahead and try to figure out all the things that could come out wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others aren't so evident.
I'm going to start with <unk>
In the house, it takes a place for things that are really <unk>
This sounds common and it is, but there is a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to bring track of the location of the important things, where the good fish, which is where the fish, which is where the tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, the <unk> sense of <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, the very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move very much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, reading and <unk>
So in the house that you go home -- a place for keys, a hook along to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a drawer drawer for it.
For your reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone -- a picture of your credit card card license, they will go <unk> by mail for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making decisions, and actually for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that the high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help to reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most active drugs in the world today, you may even be able to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most of the doctors don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you should think of what kind of statistic <unk> it's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not blame for the doctor, and if it's guilt about the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very good <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs just works just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before it would help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> and muscle pain and chronic pain, but now they think, 5 percent is not very likely to take me to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the disease, isn't it? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out <unk> by the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this necessary number of dealing with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the major men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to try is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just take a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before time, the questions that you can make up the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
So because you have a choice, many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at the time is that it turns out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face <unk> face with a predator -- you don't need the system of <unk> or <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not often the lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is kind of rational thinking as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail ever at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent things bad on the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the gate on the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
It's extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That is my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the course of time, mixed with local signs, and the language is developed today that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world -- is as if I lived in a foreign country, and by going to <unk> their rules and <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do you understand the sound from?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get on the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
Let's try to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, make it with my thumb -- so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
Over this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now sound has entered my art of art.
I'm going to tell you more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and focus on my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me as the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and do it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the number of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people that can support me as well as to become my voice.
So I'm capable of being relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and my identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value, something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to focus on <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, it will be in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capturing and fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very highly <unk> and highly <unk> meaning that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different parameters are different.
If you give you a different parameter for every single finger while it touches the piano, as the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, as the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in the place to express a concept of clear or idea of <unk>
If just a key to the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- they can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and push it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and wears it.
This is all day."
If you will, and <unk> the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents what time is expressed in <unk> and how far the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand. Two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and we were going back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> hand. <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both on my head like your chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, third, please give you again.
And again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they carry very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and Russia like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich treasure. And I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to invite you to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say to me, "You can tell them everything, but then you have to <unk>
Compassion involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because adults lied to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the others.
The time time, I am now adult and invention and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach to walk with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out of these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic chunks of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream of invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids are very keen to be able to participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools are cool and safe.
Not exactly.
So let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it as much as we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something we expect it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids were getting a lot with robots.
Then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we will transform lamps and camera cameras on laughter, and I put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer computer is processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would give it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to try and fix it immediately.
I was able to investigate my <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you start with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
It was very shocked by because this is the water that is <unk> it's the water where water comes to the water where they live in.
You can also see that water is brown, and the mud and oil also are brown color and when everything gets over, it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help each other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> removed various cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant to Fukushima, nuclear power close to water.
And today, according to the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of traces by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems to be that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most people, at the time, it has safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and researching with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the job seriously, but they did because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data, we discussed that day and talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
This is what we were able to notice that the radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But based on that we organized a civil expedition, the nearest close to the nuclear center to date.
We zoom in up to 1.5 miles from nuclear power, and with the fishermen help from the area we gather sediments from the sea floor with a tracking tracking of sediment as we invented and built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became such a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space that's dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood -- metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, you can basically build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked, "We can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility at the age of advanced age transforming their chairs into new vehicles in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are our lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens -- <unk> creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a silk dragline kind of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is invisible to the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the distribution in raw, he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
<unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But life are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass manufacturing.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world that is made from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are warmer with little <unk>
You're acting mostly like filter, the other primarily as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the <unk> of every designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown in both screens after me.
My work, in his simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, traveling out of the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment in history, where those four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, large-scale arm -- like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a basis that some day not very distant to print <unk> buildings, and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen, where every aperture is only to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> are like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> no seams between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a functional scanner.
That designers have access to this high-tech analytical and the instruments that are allowed to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair -- a chair at the time, comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
This is the surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious person, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with twigs, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be design if objects were made from a single piece?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to put the kind of material from the tree to be attached to fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms that are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or crabs, <unk>
We thought that if we could tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical <unk> we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print out the large-scale structures there was built a system with multiple top-down <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single material 3.5 feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that are going to be made without <unk> effects, and if it grows even further, to windows.
A microbial tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, including <unk> life and placed on the ground to grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of making clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the board, we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological structures inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other means sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, not interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the killer tract that will help you to attach these bacteria and that we will raise their function away.
So we started growing those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the material of <unk>
If we wanted to get more <unk> they have more transparent channels.
This outer system is <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our small intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are growing creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the native tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home in which it <unk>
Real manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through a combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first gets place in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, is manifest in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, glue a little magnet to the head of a worm worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm.
Yet by putting the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we <unk> a cocoon flat and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different settings -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
Often the silk worms come up to death within its <unk> their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without a boiling <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we added this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar path to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, throw silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We <unk> <unk> silk worms to a online <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to deal with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much lower.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
At <unk> silk is biological silk about <unk> <unk> -- they give this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit over two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a form of two material ecology designers have to unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a very very nature of design, which demands of us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
They can stick with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and art and saw the website and then he played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it off.
But then I'm going to tell me about something else, something completely different, and I was <unk> on it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it off.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me so much anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure about how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to pick a thing, to deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk>
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have put me back then.
We learn themselves, where to allocate meaning of bad or abnormal to make things.
I'm going to tell you where they were talking about the culture.
So let me first tell you what you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what it is that we were at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask you to pick in university.
And at some point, what do you want to be from <unk>
It turns out of being the cute exercise before it takes away the dream.
Why?
Now, if this question is inspired by children to dream about what might be, is not inspired to dream everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are good at <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this was Amy editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the true <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to devote during your time on this ground, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that take their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel like that.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> multiple <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms that would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was very well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It looks like a species to adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared on cartography, visualization of data, and trips and design, when he found <unk>
<unk> is a company who creates <unk> jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
There comes to new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is fast learning.
When we were <unk> we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and go out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new zone that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a pianist were <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I was becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the finest mechanics when their practices began to start their thumb, and this ability to write a compelling day for the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to go to what you get to you, even if you end up the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, but a web designer designer -- sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes it seems like James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The magazine Report Company define adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, which actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're ready to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have -- right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from his belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and <unk> offers a ample breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design life and careers that we can relate to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part of them are given to them to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you have to take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever.
If you're a heart doctor, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including the ones that you just realized about being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep your curiosity out of those <unk> <unk>
You know, the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman called <unk> they took a <unk> to a <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, she was done by a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he was going to do, he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But recently, it's been moved into Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's and more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, your possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your <unk> years is <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be treated with Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars, every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spend on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the boom. boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the world's first causes of death of all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who can't be allowed to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than disease than of other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research, than Alzheimer's percent despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world -- Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of an old human brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient.
In addition to unleashed severe memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strange <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like a mess bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we get it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the people have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physical, engineers, mathematicians.
And together, we've achieved a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a lot of videos from what happened when these drugs were <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see it moves normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stick into each other, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in this early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just an initial result of a positive results, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there's real hope about what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince us that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can get it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on government and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden hidden victims of their loved ones and night are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
It was <unk> this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper comes to a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience by testing it as a night last night.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers would be <unk> to get <unk> and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number one: If you could wake up morning with one quality or skill, what would be?
Number three: When was the last time you ever met.
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner -- what do you like to him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to be killed.
But I thought it was a good story, and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send them to the spine Love to a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, they still keep together still yet.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go to the subject.
A week before I was published that article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand views.
And that has a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it, I had no idea.
This was an article published on Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, me, I had called the "Today Show and "Good Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with <unk> <unk> experience, but another thing is to find that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- that the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or I had a little bit, what they did every day for weeks, they asked the first question: They are still following together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared right away.
They were from students and journalists and strangers -- like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to sit comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers by testing the study with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all of this is to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public <unk> together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of the I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really wanted to do it, I mean, if I was able to produce love, not only one adventure, but love, real love, <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a couple of months and I felt about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do we know whether to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. <unk> <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was trying to encourage interpersonal view among university students, using what he called called <unk> personal <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic isn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer to do that, several studies, later studies, they also used historic protocol protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community. And they've used it among people from the political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately you never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like it was <unk>
And I said, "You want to say that you will tell you about the person who I <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that I did get better better after testing the research <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he searching.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to practically my entire adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took to the science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I wrote in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with the knowledge of the romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much as they can reasonably help me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media talked about about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in some ways to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story because in love in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, keep together?
And their content with a Yes or No.
So more than a question, we want to make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do we stay in love when things get wrong, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live to your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be there.
I didn't think how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, having chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe about.
And what I did, and what maybe my life is looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the ultimate happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by lesbian <unk> and in a way I became a <unk> of the forest.
And in New York City, a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and it took a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humanoid humanoid would find this box about 500 years later, and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still <unk>
At a time because I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make <unk> and all those things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> such as Agnes <unk> the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened.
So I did I <unk> <unk> <unk>
This time, I began to add electronic elements, frogs out strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out the whole thing about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw the same as it takes around a body of <unk>
I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, they will be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing in a window, then in a window and another window, and I had all these windows together, and I had all these three-dimensional <unk>
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 3,000 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It's got <unk> so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh <unk> where it <unk>
So here is where the creatures with animals are headed back to <unk> ready to commit suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> bin Laden, and there's all sorts of rare things you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
So anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a 5.5 foot <unk> a <unk> tail.
But anyway, his tail turn fire into a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Its tail ends up in a <unk> of <unk> made out of <unk> terrorists in 1986.
They've <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> for his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But every single acts of a kind of a kind of a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They are like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
And each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1,300 kilos with a single human inside inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover your penis or <unk> or whatever it has has, a kind of thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, and you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a radio <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it strikes each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When one <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we come to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, that doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we didn't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against the pain, first the <unk> and the <unk> and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective system, the most effective system for any drug to direct your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects in its negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current -- you get worse and worse for the time that it takes to come to its destiny, which is where it's most important in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream of patients that are being committed to antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a living treatment for the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it to <unk> for caring care and surgery of diabetes, you can be used for anything to do, including transportation transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill up extremely small holes, that open and close holes, almost immediately the cells living with HIV to introduce medicines.
Maybe you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the cell membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid containing the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head is a camera, it's headed to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the virus, it frees it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the energy on.
Well, this doesn't look very much about it.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total of HIV <unk>
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream researcher in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, not <unk> and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
So what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these terrorist agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation,
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even need to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful health resolution.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't survive.
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> met by its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also serves <unk> from Gaza since 2007.
So these groups are doing more than just shooting.
multitasking.
And we put a complex machine, by <unk> stations on TV, channels, websites and Internet websites and social networks.
And here's the magazine <unk> printed in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business -- for example, business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better pick and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put professional training programs professional or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering the state of security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan destroyed by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated range of the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling up a vacuum divide, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill together <unk> gaps by government, and it comes up with armed groups, political groups, participating in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations, the less we can see it as something contrary to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, run all of their <unk> collect the trash, and run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations with no state and hybrids and the more weak the states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap of non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we better understand groups better -- we'll understand how to incentives to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- <unk> military power can win some battles, but we will not give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that security vacuum -- to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a Laptop but quite bad.
And therefore I was feeling like a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a book -- and a book called "The <unk> and after the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are all around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be feminist.
It was labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I would give me a woman as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, he asks a lot, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman, and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same job for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible to the contraceptives and affordable services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music at all volume.
Although the letter degrades into women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely influenced by my musical ear.
I firmly believe in the work of man -- which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks but also killing insects, the collection of trash, <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They came from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales, which come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, I accepted that election, too.
The problem is not that it becomes financially financially vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they behave.
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color -- gay workers, gay workers, <unk> <unk> and high school <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist claim.
It also happens, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put it into a <unk>
We expect it to be <unk>
When we get to <unk> the <unk> with a lot of fun from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think about that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear that it means that it's not being able to accomplish with a little fear of <unk>
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> to see this star of <unk> to have openly feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments if they were <unk> it was not a feminist.
It takes his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go far beyond the sane <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad pun or rather, a <unk> is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action to be a little more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to give us a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change to affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music got so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions relate to this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> in three and four years.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and shiny and too <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were passionate about how strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will become as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sex violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in the other part when movies don't deal with women than they are like <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports support, where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially young white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't add a number of women enough to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publishing or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they tend to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also help them be even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to decision choices.
Because we are not a <unk> <unk> without adopting these <unk> our gains.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expecting our decisions to go to the top, to people in the power school and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create an durable and significant change.
We can also claim to the courage our story -- well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist at <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys were <unk> when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
It <unk> my voice, and after all of me don't dare to believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would become a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script and of feminism, I also found that if I was a bit brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I argue the golden reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad friend. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because he visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
And one of the amazing things of this outbreak is that <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, was not the paper that sparked the controversial about autism, and the vaccine was <unk> somewhere and marked by being an fraud <unk> by British Medical School.
It doesn't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism, is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increasing estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creates all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence remained stable so only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center of Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnosis -- and "a better detection detection to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his two-year-old son of visual contact.
If the <unk> criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what country has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the rational power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed <unk> worlds that seemed <unk> worlds that seemed <unk> worlds -- even their own parents.
You could have fun for hours waving their hands on their faces, but they were prey to the panic -- like when he didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to her office and not giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully at a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster into certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned to two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970, that the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had an autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years earlier.
They launched a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit into nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he said, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation to English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he would <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
And his author was a man named Hans <unk> and he ran an integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with <unk> music, and kids follow their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disabled and <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's I called them their little teachers, and they started to help the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of bold and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in architectural culture as the awkward social scientist as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even to say, that for success in science and art, one ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes got into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a comprehensive <unk>
These changes don't fell on <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with each story to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he was coming out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with four <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I wasn't supposed to have a connection to that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that so it was, how do people with autism, and their families finally get support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for the vaccine for the <unk> and a simple, powerful story, and <unk> credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of <unk> children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that they are the puzzles to solve the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with ability, communities communities, and parents with support for their children.
One autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck and <unk> the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
